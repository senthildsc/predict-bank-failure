# predict bank failure

The most common cause of bank failure occurs when the value of the bank's assets falls to below the market value of the bank's liabilities, which are the bank's obligations to creditors and depositors. This might happen because the bank loses too much on its investments.
Although today's challenges are great, the four underlying reasons for bank failures have not changed from those of years' past, which are:
An imbalance of risk versus return
Failure to diversify,
Offering products and services that management doesn't fully understand, and
Poor management of risks.
